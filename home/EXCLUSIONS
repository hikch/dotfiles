# Partial links (handled separately via PARTIAL_LINKS)
# Note: PARTIAL_LINKS in Makefile specifies nested paths that should be symlinked
# while their parent directories are excluded. This allows selective deployment of
# subdirectories without symlinking the entire parent.
# Example: .local is excluded, but .local/share/devbox/global/default is symlinked
# .config and .local are auto-excluded as PARTIAL_TOPS
