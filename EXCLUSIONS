# Deploy exclusions
# Files and directories to exclude from deployment
# One per line, comments start with #

# Git and system files
.DS_Store
.git
.gitmodules
.gitignore

# Internal dotfiles tools

# Claude settings (user-specific)
.claude

# Partial links (handled separately)
# Note: PARTIAL_LINKS in Makefile specifies nested paths that should be symlinked
# while their parent directories are excluded. This allows selective deployment of
# subdirectories without symlinking the entire parent.
# Example: .local is excluded, but .local/share/devbox/global/default is symlinked
# .local
