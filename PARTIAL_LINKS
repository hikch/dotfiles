# Partial link targets
# Parent directories are excluded, but these specific nested paths are symlinked
# One per line, comments start with #
#
# Use this for selective deployment of subdirectories without symlinking
# the entire parent directory.
#
# Example: .local is excluded by default, but we want to symlink
# .local/share/devbox/global/default specifically

# Devbox global configuration
.local/share/devbox/global/default

# Config management (replacing .config/.gitignore)
# Directories: managed as whole directories
.config/fish
.config/gemini
.config/iterm2

# Files: individual file management to avoid unwanted files
.config/git/ignore
